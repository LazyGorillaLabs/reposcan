# project_root/src/scanners/dependency_checker.py
"""
A module to check dependencies for known vulnerabilities or questionable packages.

Overall Goals:
- Get the dependencies for this file that is being scanned
- Identify and report known vulnerabilities using external tools or APIs.
- Return findings in a format consistent with other scanners (e.g., { "file_path": { "finding_category": [...] } })

Approach:
1. Identify Dependencies:
   - For Python: Parse requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or setup.py to extract package names and versions.
   - For Node.js: Parse package.json and lock files.
   - For other ecosystems in the future, add more logic as needed.

2. Run Vulnerability Checks:
   - Option A: Use external tools like `pip-audit` for Python or `npm audit` for Node.js, parse their JSON output.
   - Option B: Query vulnerability APIs (like the OSV API or GitHub Advisory Database).
   - Eventually, we could combine these approaches, starting simple (external tools) and expanding as needed.

3. Report Findings:
   - Produce a dictionary that maps individual dependencies to findings.
   - Integrate seamlessly with final reporting. Possibly a "dependency_concerns" key containing arrays of vulnerabilities.

Future Considerations (just keep in mind for now, noting in the code where it may go in future:
- Caching results to avoid repeatedly querying APIs (lots of imports may be the same from run to run, can assume no new vulnerabilities within a single run timeframe).
- Allowing configuration for different vulnerability sources.
- Providing remediation suggestions or direct CVE links.

Example Workflow:
- When scanning a repo:
  1. Identify project type (Python, Node, etc.) by the code of the file
  2. Pull list of dependencies to check from the file
  3. If Python: run `pip-audit` over dependencies and parse results.
  4. If Node: run `npm audit --json` and parse results.
  5. Convert output into a standardized format.
  6. Return these findings to main.py, which merges them with other scanner results.

This modular design ensures we can easily add new methods or sources of vulnerability data later.
