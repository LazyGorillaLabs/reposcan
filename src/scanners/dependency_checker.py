# project_root/src/scanners/dependency_checker.py
"""
A module to check dependencies for known vulnerabilities or questionable packages.

Overall Goals:
- Parse dependency manifests (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
- Identify and report known vulnerabilities using external tools or APIs.
- Return findings in a format consistent with other scanners (e.g., { "file_path": { "finding_category": [...] } })

Approach:
1. Identify Dependencies:
   - For Python: Parse requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or setup.py to extract package names and versions.
   - For Node.js: Parse package.json and lock files.
   - For other ecosystems in the future, add more logic as needed.

2. Run Vulnerability Checks:
   - Option A: Use external tools like `pip-audit` for Python or `npm audit` for Node.js, parse their JSON output.
   - Option B: Query vulnerability APIs (like the OSV API or GitHub Advisory Database).
   - Eventually, we could combine these approaches, starting simple (external tools) and expanding as needed.

3. Report Findings:
   - Produce a dictionary that maps either:
     - The manifest file (e.g., requirements.txt) to a set of findings (package, version, known CVEs), or
     - Individual dependencies to findings.
   - Integrate seamlessly with final reporting. Possibly a "dependency_issues" key containing arrays of vulnerabilities.

Future Considerations:
- Caching results to avoid repeatedly querying APIs.
- Allowing configuration for different vulnerability sources.
- Providing remediation suggestions or direct CVE links.

Example Workflow:
- When scanning a repo:
  1. Identify project type (Python, Node, etc.) by checking for certain files.
  2. If Python: run `pip-audit` and parse results.
  3. If Node: run `npm audit --json` and parse results.
  4. Convert output into a standardized format.
  5. Return these findings to main.py, which merges them with other scanner results.

This modular design ensures we can easily add new methods or sources of vulnerability data later.

def identify_dependencies(repo_path: str) -> dict:

    Identify dependencies in the given repository path.

    - In a real implementation, scan repo_path for known manifest files.
    - Parse them to extract dependencies.
